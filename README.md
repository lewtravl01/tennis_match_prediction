## Learning Objectives

After this lesson, students will be able to:
- Define data modeling and how to apply a simple linear regression.
- Build a linear regression model using a dataset that meets the linearity assumption, using the sci-kit learn library.
- Produce and interpret coefficients and intercept from a regression analysis.
- Produce and interpret various metrics for evaluation of a regression analysis.
- Define and identify multicollinearity in a multiple regression.

## Student Requirements

Before this lesson(s), students should already be able to:
- Collect data and perform basic data manipulations with Pandas
- Import libraries into Python scripts
- Create simple data visualizations using Python
- Explain basic statistical concepts including linear algebra and descriptive statistics
